## 2. Executive Summary

> One paragraph. State the system being specified, the business need it addresses, who the primary stakeholders are, and the critical success criteria. A reader should understand the full scope of this document in 60 seconds.

**Example:** This document specifies the requirements for a webhook delivery subsystem integrated into the OwnPay payment gateway. The system must reliably deliver event notifications to merchant-configured endpoints, retry on failure with exponential backoff, support HMAC-SHA256 request signing, and sustain a throughput of 10,000 events per minute at 99.5% delivery success rate.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

- [Specific capability 1]
- [Specific capability 2]
- [Specific integration or interface]

### 3.2 Out of Scope

> 🔴 Explicitly stating what is NOT built is as important as what is. This prevents scope creep.

- [Excluded capability 1 — reason: will be addressed in Phase 2]
- [Excluded capability 2 — reason: owned by external system X]

### 3.3 System Boundary

```
[External Actor / System A] --[input/event]--> [ THIS SYSTEM ] --[output/result]--> [External Actor / System B]
```

## 6. Functional Requirements

> Each requirement uses EARS syntax. Assign a unique FR-XXX ID. Every FR must have at least one verifiable acceptance criterion.

### 6.1 [Feature / Subsystem Name]

#### FR-001: [Requirement Name]

**Statement:** When `[trigger event]`, the system shall `[action/behavior]`.

**Rationale:** [Why this is required - link to business need or stakeholder goal]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `GIVEN` [precondition] `WHEN` [action] `THEN` [expected outcome]
- `GIVEN` [edge case precondition] `WHEN` [action] `THEN` [expected outcome]

**Priority:** `Must Have` | `Should Have` | `Could Have` | `Won't Have`
**Owner:** [Stakeholder class]

---

#### FR-002: [Requirement Name]

**Statement:** The `<system>` shall `<action>`.

**Rationale:** [Reason]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `GIVEN` [...] `WHEN` [...] `THEN` [...]

**Priority:** `Must Have`
**Owner:** [Stakeholder class]

---

> 🔵 Open Question: [Unresolved requirement that needs stakeholder clarification before implementation]

### 6.2 [Next Feature / Subsystem]

#### FR-010: [Requirement Name]

[Follow the same structure as above]

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

> Every NFR must be measurable. "The system shall be fast" is not a valid NFR. "The system shall respond to 99th percentile API requests within 200ms" is.

### 7.1 Performance

#### NFR-001: Response Latency

**Statement:** The system shall process and respond to [operation type] requests within `[X]ms` at the `[P99]` percentile under a load of `[N]` concurrent users.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Load test confirms p99 latency ≤ `Xms` at `N` concurrent users.

---

#### NFR-002: Throughput

**Statement:** The system shall sustain a throughput of at least `[N]` requests/events per second/minute under steady-state load without degradation.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Sustained load test at `N` RPS for 10 minutes with < 0.1% error rate.

---

### 7.2 Scalability

#### NFR-010: Horizontal Scale

**Statement:** The system shall scale horizontally by adding instances without requiring application code changes or downtime.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Adding `N` additional instances results in proportional throughput increase (linear scaling within 15% variance).

---

### 7.3 Availability and Reliability

#### NFR-020: Uptime SLA

**Statement:** The system shall maintain `[X]%` uptime measured on a monthly rolling basis, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Monitoring confirms uptime ≥ `X`% in any 30-day period.

---

#### NFR-021: MTTR

**Statement:** The Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) from any single-component failure shall not exceed `[N] minutes`.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Chaos engineering test confirms recovery within `N` minutes for [failure scenario].

---

### 7.4 Security

#### NFR-030: Authentication

**Statement:** All API endpoints exposed by this system shall require `[authentication mechanism - e.g., JWT Bearer token / API Key / mTLS]`. Unauthenticated requests shall be rejected with HTTP 401.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Pen-test confirms no endpoint is accessible without valid credentials.

---

#### NFR-031: Data Encryption

**Statement:** All data transmitted between system components shall use TLS 1.2 or higher. All sensitive data at rest shall be encrypted using AES-256.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Security scan confirms no plaintext transmission; storage encryption verified by auditing key management config.

---

#### NFR-032: Input Validation

**Statement:** The system shall validate and sanitize all inputs at the system boundary. Malformed or oversized inputs shall be rejected with HTTP 400 before processing.

**Acceptance Criterion:** OWASP ZAP scan returns zero high-severity injection findings.

---

### 7.5 Compliance

#### NFR-040: [Regulatory Standard - e.g., PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA]

**Statement:** The system shall comply with `[Standard Name vX.X]` requirements, specifically: `[List specific controls - e.g., PCI-DSS Requirement 6.4: secure code review before production]`.

**Acceptance Criterion:** [Compliance audit, penetration test, certification]

---

### 7.6 Maintainability

#### NFR-050: Observability

**Statement:** The system shall emit structured logs (JSON format) for every request/event processed, including: timestamp, request ID, operation type, duration, outcome (success/error), and error code if applicable.

**Acceptance Criterion:** All log fields present in 100% of sampled log entries during integration testing.
