## Context

> Describe the situation that makes this decision necessary. What forces are at play? What problem, opportunity, or constraint is this decision responding to?
>
> Be specific and factual. Avoid framing this as a defense of the chosen option - write it as if you have not made the decision yet. A reader should fully understand the problem space without any prior knowledge.
>
> Include relevant constraints: team skills, existing infrastructure, timeline, regulatory requirements, performance data, failure history.

[Context - write with specificity. Include numbers, evidence, and constraints where available.]

---

## Decision

**We will [chosen approach / technology / pattern].**

[1-3 sentences on how this decision is implemented in practice. Specific enough that an engineer can act on it without asking follow-up questions.]

---

## Rationale

> Why was this option chosen? Be specific. Reference evidence, benchmarks, or principles. Avoid vague statements like "it seemed like the right fit" or "it was the most popular option."

[Evidence-based rationale. If you ran a PoC or benchmark, cite the results. If a specific technical constraint forced the decision, state it.]

## Alternatives Considered

> **This section is mandatory.** Documenting rejected alternatives prevents future engineers from re-investigating paths already evaluated, and demonstrates that the decision was made with due diligence.

### Option 1: [Name of this alternative]

**What it is:** [Brief, neutral description]

**Why it was rejected:**
- [Specific reason - e.g., "Does not support point-in-time recovery required by our 30-day backup policy"]
- [Specific reason 2 - with evidence where available]

**What we lose by not choosing it:** [The genuine upside of this alternative that we forgo]

---

### Option 2: [Name of this alternative]

**What it is:** [Brief, neutral description]

**Why it was rejected:**
- [Specific reason]
- [Specific reason 2]

**What we lose by not choosing it:** [The genuine upside]

---

### Option 3: [Name of this alternative] *(optional)*

**What it is:** [Description]

**Why it was rejected:**
- [Specific reason]

## Consequences

> Every architectural decision has trade-offs. Be honest about both the benefits and the costs. An ADR that only lists positive consequences is incomplete and will erode trust when the negatives materialize.

### Positive Consequences

- [What becomes better or easier]
- [Risk that is eliminated]
- [Constraint that is satisfied]

### Negative Consequences / Trade-offs

- [What becomes harder or more constrained]
- [New dependency introduced]
- [Skill gap that must be addressed]
- [Future flexibility that is reduced]

### Risks Introduced

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Specific risk this decision introduces] | `Low` / `Med` / `High` | `Low` / `Med` / `High` | [How mitigated] |

## Compliance and Governance

> Only include if relevant.

- [e.g., This decision satisfies PCI-DSS Requirement 8.3 (strong authentication for all access to the cardholder data environment)]
- [e.g., Reviewed and approved by Security on YYYY-MM-DD]
