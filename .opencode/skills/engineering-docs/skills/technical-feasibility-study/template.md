## 2. Proposal Description

### 2.1 What Is Being Proposed

[A clear, objective description of the technical approach, technology, or architecture being evaluated. Be specific enough that a reviewer who did not attend the original discussion understands exactly what is being assessed.]

### 2.2 Why This Is Being Considered

[The business or technical driver. What problem does this solve? Why is this approach being considered over the current state or obvious alternatives?]

### 2.3 Evaluation Criteria

[Define what "feasible" means in this context. What must be true for a "Go" recommendation?]

| Criterion | Target | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [e.g., Delivery within timeline] | [e.g., 4 months] | `Must Meet` |
| [e.g., No new infrastructure dependencies] | [e.g., Runs on existing stack] | `Should Meet` |
| [e.g., Proven at scale] | [e.g., Used in production at 10K+ RPS] | `Nice to Have` |

| Community / maintenance | [e.g., Active OSS with 5-year commit history] | `High` |
| Known limitations | [e.g., Does not support X, breaks at Y scale] | |

### 3.2 Integration Complexity

| Integration Point | Complexity | Risk | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [System / API / Protocol] | `Low` / `Medium` / `High` | `Low` / `Medium` / `High` | [Evidence or concern] |

### 3.3 Proof of Concept Results

> 🔵 Open Question: If a PoC has not been run, state it here and recommend one before proceeding.

| PoC Objective | Result | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [What was validated] | `Pass` / `Fail` / `Partial` | [Link / benchmark / observation] |

### 3.4 Technical Blockers

| Blocker | Severity | Resolvable? | Resolution Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Identified technical obstacle] | `Critical` / `Major` / `Minor` | `Yes` / `No` / `Unknown` | [How to resolve if possible] |

## 4. Resource Feasibility Assessment

> **Verdict: `Feasible` | `Conditionally Feasible` | `Not Feasible`**

### 4.1 Skills Assessment

| Required Skill | Current Team Capability | Gap | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Skill area] | `Strong` / `Moderate` / `None` | `None` / `Moderate` / `Critical` | [Training / Hire / Consultant] |

### 4.2 Timeline Assessment

| Phase | Estimated Effort | Realistic Duration | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Research / Spike | [N days] | [N weeks] | `High` / `Medium` / `Low` |
| Implementation | [N person-weeks] | [N months] | |
| Testing / Integration | [N person-weeks] | [N months] | |
| **Total** | | | |

**Available capacity:** [N engineers at X% allocation over Y months = Z person-weeks available]
**Required capacity:** [N person-weeks]
**Gap:** [Delta - is this feasible?]

### 4.3 Infrastructure and Cost

| Resource | Required | Current State | Delta | Estimated Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 5. Operational Feasibility Assessment

> **Verdict: `Feasible` | `Conditionally Feasible` | `Not Feasible`**

| Documentation / runbook | `Yes` / `Partial` / `No` | [Description] | [Action] |

### 5.2 Migration and Transition

[If this replaces an existing system: how do users and data transition? What is the rollback path if the new system fails after rollout?]

| Technical complexity underestimated | Medium | High | High | Run a time-boxed PoC. Cap exploration at 2 weeks. |
| Key skill not available in team | Low | High | High | Identify specialist contractor now; budget pre-approved |
| Third-party API changes breaking integration | Low | Medium | Medium | Pin API version; monitor change log; write abstraction layer |

### 6.1 Fallback Options

[If this approach fails mid-implementation, what is the fallback? Is the fallback viable?]

| Fallback Option | Viability | Cost of Switching | When to Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Alternative approach] | `High` / `Medium` / `Low` | [Description] | [Trigger condition] |
